Strings: Quotes, Interpolation, Escaping, and Buffers
=====================================================

Strings are the most important data structure in shell.  Oil makes them easier
and safer!

This doc addresses these questions:

- How do you write different kinds of strings in Oil programs?
- How do they behave at runtime?  What are the common operations?
- What are the recommended ways to use them?

Shell Features:

- Quotes (single or double quoted)
- Interpolation aka substitution (variable, command, etc.)

Oil Features:

- Escaping for safety: `${x|html}`, etc.
- Buffers for efficiency and readability: `${.myproc arg1}`, etc.
  - (buffers are PHP-like)

<div id="toc">
</div>

## Summary

- Oil has three ways to write strings: single quoted, double quoted, and
  C-style (which is also QSN-style).
- Each of the three types has a multiline variant.  They are Python-style
  triple-quoted, but they also strip leading space in an intelligent way.
- TODO: For string safety, Oil adds the concept of "escapers" and interpolation
  with `$[x]` (square brackets)
- TODO: For convenience and performance, Oil adds buffers and *builtin
  substitution*: `${.myproc arg1}`.

### For Python/JS/C Users

- Single and double quotes are different.    Double quotes allow interpolation.
- Neither style of string respects backslash escapes like `\n` for newline.
  You have to use the third form.

### For Shell Users

- Oil replaces here docs with Python-style triple-quoted strings.

Preferences:

- Unquoted strings (command mode only)
- Single-quoted strings
  - when you need to express special characters
  - QSN
- Double-quoted strings
  - with `$[]` interpolation
  - with `${}` interpolation
  - with fast command sub `${.myproc arg1}

### Quick Reference

    echo unquoted          # bare words are allowed in command mode

    echo 'with spaces'     # single quoted string
    var s = 'with spaces'

    # Raw single quoted string, to emphasize literal backslashes
    var s = r'C:\Program Files\'

    # C-escaped single quoted string
    var line = $'foo\n'

    # double quoted with safe interpolation (TODO)
    echo "<p>hello $[name]</p>"       # default_escaper must be set
    echo "<p>hello ${name|html}</p>"  # explicit escaper

    # double quoted with unsafe interpolation
    echo "hello $name"
    echo "hello ${name}_suffix"       # braces delimit variable name

    echo $(date +%x)                  # command sub

Still TODO:

    echo ${.myproc arg1}

    cat <<< '''
       one
       two
       '''

    cat <<< $'''
       mu = \u{3bc}
       nul = \x00
       '''

    var s = """
       multiline with ${vars}
       $(date +%x)
       ${.myproc arg1}
       """


## Use Unquoted Strings in Command Mode

Shell is unique!  You don't have to quote strings.

- link: command vs. expression mode

and quoted strings in expression mode

## Two Kinds of Single-Quoted Strings

### Raw with `r'C:\Program Files\'`

- TODO: `parse_raw_strings`

### C-Escaped With `$'foo\n'` 

- Use the [QSN]($xref) subset

### QSN For *Data* Interchange

TODO: explain the difference.

This is different!  It's data and not code.  Analogy to JSON.

- When you want represent any string on a single line (filenames)
- To make binary data readable
- To display data in a terminal (protect against terminal codes)

## Use Double-Quoted Strings For Interpolation

### Implicit Safe Interpolation with `$[x]` (TODO)

- Use `$[x]` for safe interpolation
  - Respects `shopt --set default_escaper`

### Explicit Safe Interpolation With `${x|html}` (TODO)

- Use `${x|html}` for safe interpolation

Note you can have bugs if you use the wrong escaper!

### Raw Interpolation with `$x` (may be unsafe)

- Use `$x` or `${x}`
  - These are identical except for syntax
- Useful for log messages, which aren't security sensitive

Note that you should **not** use `"${var}"` in Oil code.  Use `$var` or
`${var}` because of simple word evaluation.

### Command Sub `$(echo hi)` 

### Fast Command Sub `${.myproc}` (stdout capture)

Note that only words are allowed here; not full commands.  Wrap other commands
in a proc.

- Using `write_to_buffer`

TODO:

   echo ${.myproc foo|html}  # I think this should be supported

## Escapers / Codecs (TODO)

For `${x|html}` and `${.myproc|html}`

TODO

- how to register them
- wasm plugins?

## Use Triple Quoted Strings Instead of Here Docs (TODO)

TODO

## Concatenate With `"$str1$str2"`

Or `"${str1}${str2}"`

- is `s ++ t` valid?. It isn't necessary for strings and lists
  - `%(@a @b)` is the same for lists
  - does this Python syntax also work?  `[*a, *b]`
  - Dicts: `{d, **e}` might be better

### Avoid Concatenation in a Loop

    setvar s = "${s}${suffix}"

## Append with Two Styles

Since there is no `++` operator, there is no `++=` operator.

### `echo`, `printf`, `write`, and `${.myproc}` (`write_to_buffer`)

echo, printf, and write have their output captured.

    proc p(arg) {
      ### A proc that has its output captured quickly.

      echo $arg
      write two

      const x = 'three'
      printf '%s\n' $x

      # newline for interactive testing, but not when captured
      if ! shopt -q write_to_buffer {
        echo  
      }
    }

    echo ${.p one}  # $'one\ntwo\nthree\n'

### `push` and `join`

    var buf = %()
    push :buf 'one '
    push :buf $'two\n'
    echo $[join(buf)]

## Appendix A: Deprecated Shell Constructs

- here docs!
  - Use tripled quoted strings.
- Backticks for command sub
  - Use `$(echo hi)`
- Arithmetic substitution like `$((1 + 2))`
  - Use Oil expressions: `$[1 + 2]`
- `${x%%prefix}` and so forth
  - Use builtin Oil functions (TODO)
- Unused: bash `$""` for localization?
